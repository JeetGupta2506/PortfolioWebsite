                    My journey in AI is built on a comprehensive foundation. I started with the core principles of Machine Learning, mastering the algorithms that extract patterns from data. This led me to the world of Deep Learning, where I built and trained complex neural networks for vision and language tasks. My passion for language and understanding naturally steered me toward Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I worked on everything from text classification to machine translation.

Today, my focus is on the most dynamic field to emerge from this convergence: Generative AI. I see it as the culmination of ML, DL, and NLP, and I am dedicated to building the next generation of intelligent systems. My work involves leveraging Large Language Models to create solutions that can reason, generate, and collaborate—whether it's through building accurate RAG systems, customizing models for specific domains, or creating frameworks for AI agents to work in concert.

I am not just an algorithm developer; I am an engineer who builds end-to-end systems that are reliable, scalable, and truly intelligent.
